Week 2 Notes:

Fibonacci: 
(FUN FACT) This program for the first coding question that I was ever asked
This program starts with 2 number 0 and 1 and then add them and the pattern go on forever.

Itertative implemenation is much slower than the recursive implemtation. 
I noticed Fibonacci grows rapidly but factional grow even more rapidly. 
Factional 25 is a huge number and isnt able to be represented.


Time Dynamic Array and Deque:
